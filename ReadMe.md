SmartHome
============================

A smart home app that allows users to conveniently manage their smart appliances. Users can add or remove devices and control them on their phones. Due to time constraints, my app will not be interacting with real devices, but rather virtual devices stored in the local database.

The app also reads real-time data from external sensors and visualize them as graphs. At present, these sensors are also virtual and are simulated by a script emitting random data to an MQTT broker.
